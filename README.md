# Students_Data_Analysis
This project analyzes student data using Python libraries (NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). It explores gender distribution, the positive impact of parental education on courses, and the non-impact of marital status on education. It also examines ethnic group distribution using bar graphs and pie charts for clear visual insights.
